        "\n",
        "This project analyzes issue tracking, resolution patterns, and changelog activity using a public Apache JIRA dataset. Leveraging PySpark, we examine issue lifecycles, team collaboration, and resolution times. The analysis includes engineered features, grouping strategies, and filtering based on time (last two years) to generate valuable insights.\n",

        "---\n",
        "## 🧹 Data Preprocessing\n",
        "The dataset consists of three main components:\n",
        "- `issues.csv`: metadata about each JIRA issue.\n",
        "- `changelog.csv`: tracks status changes and field updates.\n",
        "- `comments.csv`: discussion history tied to each issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "We performed the following preprocessing steps:\n",
        "- Cleaned column names by removing dots/spaces.\n",
        "- Dropped duplicates based on unique identifiers (`key`, `comment_id`, `id`).\n",
        "- Removed rows with nulls in required columns.\n",
        "- Filtered malformed timestamps (e.g., those not starting with '20').\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## 🧮 Feature Engineering\n",
        "We enriched the data with:\n",
        "- `comment_count`: Number of comments per issue.\n",
        "- `status_change_count`: Number of status field changes per issue.\n",
        "- `resolution_days`: Time taken (in days) to resolve an issue.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 🔍 Interpretation:\n",
        "- High-priority issues (e.g., Blocker, Critical) are generally expected to resolve faster.\n",
        "- However, variations within statuses (like “In Progress” or “Review”) reveal inefficiencies or bottlenecks.\n",
